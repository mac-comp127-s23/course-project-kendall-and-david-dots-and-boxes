Dots and Boxes

Names of the team members: Zhaolong Deng, Kendall Sullivan

The project is about a small game named the Dots and Boxes. This is a two-player game (on one computer) where each player takes turns placing lines on a grid and trying to avoid allowing the other player to make boxes and get points off the block (as seen in the image below). Our goal is to have many customization options for the users, such as choosing their color, deciding the winning reqiurement, entering their name (instead of player1, player2). When enough boxes are filled, the program will display which player won. Their points will be marked on the canvas as they fill in the boxes.

Testing: We will test the program visually since we are making a graphic game. And some unit tests to make sure usersâ€™ input is valid.

Libraries/Packages/APIs: 

(a). Kilt-graphics API and associated edu.macalester.graphics packages

(b). External pictures to indicate the filled boxes (e.g. letters)
