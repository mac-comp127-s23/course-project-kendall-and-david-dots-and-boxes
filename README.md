# Dots and Boxes
Names of the team members: Zhaolong Deng, Kendall Sullivan

# Project Description
- The project is about a small game named the Dots and Boxes. This is a two-player game (on one computer) where each player takes turns placing lines on a grid and trying to avoid allowing the other player to make boxes and get points off the block (as seen in the image below). When enough boxes are filled, the program will display which player won. Their points will be marked on the canvas as they fill in the boxes.

- The project only need the basic java interprelator and the package kilt graphics to operation. 

- To start a game, user can go to the "Dotandboxes" class and run the proggram. User need to input there name in the terminal to start.

# Known Issue
- We tested the program visually since we are making a graphic game, which means almost no issues in our code.

- Most of the methods' information are in the javadoc of the proggram.

# Libraries/Packages/APIs: 
- Kilt-graphics API and associated edu.macalester.graphics packages

- External pictures to indicate the filled boxes (e.g. letters)
